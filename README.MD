# Parallel Sorting Algorithms using OpenMP and MPI

## Project Description

This project implements and benchmarks Merge Sort and Quick Sort using both Sequential and Parallel (OpenMP, MPI) techniques.  
It evaluates the performance of parallel sorting strategies by comparing execution times and speedup across varying input sizes, highlighting scalability on multi-threaded and distributed systems.

The project demonstrates how algorithm design and parallel models impact sorting efficiency at different scales.
