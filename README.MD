# Parallel Sorting Algorithms using OpenMP and MPI

## Project Description

This project implements and benchmarks Merge Sort and Quick Sort using Sequential, OpenMP, and MPI techniques.  
It evaluates and compares execution times and speedup across varying input sizes to demonstrate the impact of parallelism on sorting efficiency.

## How to Run the Code

- Clone the repository.
- Follow the setup, build, and execution instructions provided in the `instructions.txt` file.
- In short:
  - Generate input using `generate_input`.
  - Compile programs using `make all`.
  - Run sequential, OpenMP, or MPI versions as needed.
  - Record execution times for analysis using `benchmark_metrics.py`.

For detailed steps and commands, **please refer to** `instructions.txt` inside this repository.
